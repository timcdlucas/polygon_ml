title: A comparison of malaria predictions using polygon models vs polygons models as a meta learner.
---

Expansion of previous analysis. This one is aiming for a journal somewhere.

1. Use Colombia, Madagascar, Indonesia and 1 or two more as case studies.
2. do cross validation on polygon.
5. probably want random cv and spatial cv?
6. Continue pre tests. Test positive constraint.
7. Move to global and local ML models.
8. compare Mae.


The scripts `run_analysis_idn.R` and `run_analysis_col.R` are the main scripts that runs the full analysis.


# First run

Indonesia and Colombia

Environmental covariates vs global PR ML vs global PR ML + environmental vs Just ML (no polygon).
