title: A comparison of malaria predictions using polygon models vs polygons models as a meta learner.
---



1. Use Colombia + Indonesia as case studies.
2. do cross validation on polygon.
5. probably want random cv and spatial cv?
7. spatial only. but need to choose year/year range.
8. compare Mae.


The scripts `run_analysis_idn.R` and `run_analysis_col.R` are the main scripts that runs the full analysis.


# First run

Indonesia and Colombia

Environmental covariates vs global PR ML vs global PR ML + environmental vs Just ML (no polygon).
